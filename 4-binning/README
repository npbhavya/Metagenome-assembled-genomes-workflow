Binning
The scripts in the directory bin or cluster contigs together if they have the same genome signatures. 

GENERATE BAM FILES 
Run the command 
	qsub 1-bamfile.sh

The script aligns each sample reads against the contig, to generate a bam and bai files with the information about the alignment. These files are the input for the binning tools we will be running next 

METABAT2
Run the command 
	qsub 2-metabat2.sh

This script runs the program metabat2 to group all the contigs that have similar 4-mer profile and contig coverage together. The bins generated are saved to a directory called "metabat_bins"

CONCOCT
Run the command 
	qsub 2-concoct.sh

This script similar to the metabat program groups contigs that have similar 4-mer profile and contigs coverage toegther.However, they do use different algorithms so the results will be different. 
The results are saved to a directory called "concoct_bins"

DAS Tool
This tool de duplicates the inforamtion from metabat generated bins and concoct generated bins to generate one final set of contigs 
Script is still work in progress

CHECKM 
This script now generates the checkm results for metabat bins, concoct bins and das tool bins to see the differences
Script in progress
