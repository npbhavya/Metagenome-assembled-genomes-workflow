This directory contains the scripts to 
1) assemble the reads using two assemblers- MEGAHIT and SPAdes 
2) Deduplicate the assembled contigs to remove the exact duplicates using bbtools, dedupe.sh script
3) All the generated contigs from MEGAHIT, SPAdes and dedupe.sh are all run through QUAST for assembly statistics 

MEGAHIT
Run the script, 
	qsub 1-megahit.sh 

This script assembles the coassembled reads (left.fq and right.fq in the reads directory), and it also continues to assembled each individual sample. 

SPADES
Run the script,
	qsub 1-spades.sh

This script assembles the coassembled reads and the reads from each individual sample. 

DEDUPLICATE the contigs from all the assemblies (both megahit and spades, and co-assemblies + individuall assemblies)
Run the command,
	qsub 2-dedupe.sh

QUAST 
Run assembly statistics for all the assemblies using QUAST
Run the command, 
	qsub 3-quast.sh 

SAVE THE FINAL OUTPUT 
Run the below command from the assembly directory
