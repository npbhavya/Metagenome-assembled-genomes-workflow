This directory is to save all of your paired end reads in fastq format.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
If you generate duplicates or any add any other additional samples to this directory, 
the binning.sh script in the later step will BE confused. Make sure to save only the file
used in the analysis here. 

Add the reamining as another directory under reads if you like, similar to what I did with 
fasta directory. 

First, for coassembly lets concatenate left and right reads
	cat *_1.fastq > left.fq
	cat *_2.fastq >right.fq
